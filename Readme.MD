### Improvements

1. If application will be scale, i propose to use some library for handling forms.
For example ```react-hook-form``` can be useful to it. In our case, we have only one form, so i decided to use native solution.
2. Add Internationalization: ```I18n``` for example


### EsLint configuration

Despite standard ```EsLint``` configuration i always use not so popular, but really helpful libraries.
   
1. ```eslint-plugin-sort-destructure-keys``` - great library to sort keys alphabetically. Very useful to organize props and depressurization
2. ```eslint-plugin-react-hooks```  - Strict Rules for hooks.
3. ```eslint-plugin-import``` - Separate imports for better reading.
